### DFS-Coronagraphs (C++, ML, Prolog Implementations)

The required programs must:

- read T graph descriptions (the given graph form is explained in the statements)
- check if the given graph contains exactly one circle and no other
  - if it does, then print "CORONA a1, a2, a3...", where a1,a2,a3... are the numbers of children of each subtree whose root is a circle node, sorted from smallest to largest
  - else, print "NO CORONA"
