# Numbers representation with powers of 2

Given a number N, 1 <= N <= 1.000.000.000 
we have to find if N can be witten as the sum of exactly K powers of 2(1 <= K <= 200.000)
or not. If ti can be then we must find the lexicographically smallest expression for it.
For example N = 42 -> K = 6 and 1+1+2+2+4+32. For more beautifoul output we use the coding [a1,a2,a3....aK]. Thus for N = 42 -> [2,2,1,0,0,1].
